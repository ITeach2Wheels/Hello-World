# Hello-World
Jumping down the rabbit hole...
Holes so far....
Divorced.
Decided to go back to school at 40.
Took a shot in the dark and ended up in an LPO (Lasers, Photonics and Optics) program.
Quickly realized, I'd jumped in the deep end...
Took a year or two to find my footing and find direction. 
Learned all about focal lengths, ray tracing and lasing.
Borrowed a 3d printer from the lab (yes, I actually borrowed it. Prof is thrilled when students use equipment;).
Realized printer from lab was limited, ordered my own and returned it.
Anycubic i3 MEGA arrived.  Started printing while riding the learning curve.
Bought my Son his own printer for his birthday.
Anycubic Linear Plus Delta became part of the family...
Just realized, writing my own code or modifing someone else's for these printers could be interesting.
Here we go!!  Hello GitHub!!
